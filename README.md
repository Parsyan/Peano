In this code i realize Peano number with OOP programming paradigm.
Project structure 
    peano/
            .venv
            main.py
            peano/
                  peano_number.py
                  integer_number.py
                  fraction_number.py
                  peano_number_converter.py
In main.py you can run code. 
In peano_number.py is located PeanoNumber class which is for save and calc with natural numbers, integer_number.py is for integer numbers like it and fraction_number.py
In peano_number_converter.py is located class  PeanoNumberConverter with this class we can convert str num "1" to Peano nums ["յաջորդ", "զրոյ"] and work with numbers. It's a general class for work with my code.
